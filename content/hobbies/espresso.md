# Espresso

I really like coffee, especially espresso. Personally I'm partial to cortados, which are equal parts espresso and steamed milk.

## Workflow

My current setup is is an [Encore ESP](https://www.baratza.com/en-us/product/encoretm-esp-zcg495) grinder and a [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://www.gaggia-na.com/products/gaggia-classic-pro) machine modified with the [Gaggiuino](https://gaggiuino.github.io/#/) mod. I printed and constructed an [Umikot](https://www.printables.com/model/481587-umikot-58mm-version-planetary-gear-spirograph-espr) WDT tool which has worked perfectly so far.

## Gagguino

Putting together the Gagguino has been one of my favorite projects and is probably one of the coolest things I currently own. The Gagguino mod adds a temperature probe and pressure sensor as well as a microcontroller to add PID control to the Gaggia. I use the default IUIUIU default brewing curve and it has made a perfect shot every time. I ordered the Gen 2 Gaggunio kit from [Peak Coffee](https://www.peakcoffee.cc/product/gaggiuino-v3-kit-set-gaggia-classic-pro/) and unfortunately had to wait a few months for it to arrive, however the kit was well constructed and had everything that was needed including a few spare parts. Putting it together was fairly self explanatory but somewhat difficult as the Gaggia frame is pretty cramped with all the internal wiring. 

## Favorite Blends

My current favorite espresso blends are [Shenandoah Joe's Long Frog Espresso blend](https://www.shenandoahjoe.com/shop/p/long-frog-espresso) and [Pure Intentions Black Moon](https://pureintentionscoffee.com/collections/all-products). Long frog is a fairly rich blend that mellows nicely with the addition of steamed milk, however I can't get it where I live currently. Black Moon almost tastes like chocolate and is very creamy and feels like a dessert.
