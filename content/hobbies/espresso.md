# Espresso

I really like coffee, especially espresso. Personally I'm partial to cortados, which are equal parts espresso and steamed milk.

## Workflow

My current setup is is an [Encore ESP](https://www.baratza.com/en-us/product/encoretm-esp-zcg495) grinder and a [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://www.gaggia-na.com/products/gaggia-classic-pro) machine. I am planning on upgrading the Gaggia with [Gaggiuino](https://gaggiuino.github.io/#/) parts and firmware when the parts finally arrive. I printed and contructed an [Umikot](https://www.printables.com/model/481587-umikot-58mm-version-planetary-gear-spirograph-espr) WDT tool which has worked perfectly so far.

My current favorite espresso blend is [Shenandoah Joe's Long Frog Espresso blend](https://www.shenandoahjoe.com/shop/p/long-frog-espresso). It's a fairly rich blend that mellows nicely with the addition of steamed milk.
