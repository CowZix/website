#Tarts

I started making tarts after being inspired by the YouTube channel [Chocolate Cocoa](https://www.youtube.com/@chocolate_cacao). So far I've tried 2 different fillings, the original chocolate ganashe and lemon curd. I personally like the choclate filling more but the lemon curd is just as good!
