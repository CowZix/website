# Birria

After looking for another recipe to try to slow cook I tried this one on a whim. I was inspired to try making birria after remembering a delicious taco I had late at night stopping at a random taqueria. I think this may be my new favorite slow cooker recipe to date. The recipe cuts some of the ingredients I couldn't get from my local store. I enjoy brushing the broth over the tortilla before frying and topping with oaxaca cheese, avacado, onion, and crema mexicana.
