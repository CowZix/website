# Carnitas

Recipe shamelessly stolen from my friend Vaughn. Tender and savory melt in your mouth pork that goes well with nearly everything. I usually make small tacos or just put it over rice for a great midweek meal.

**Prep time**: 20 mins **Cook time**: 2-3 hours
## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. Pork shoulder or Tenderloin
- 1/2 Onion 
- 1/2 Orange
- 4 Minced Garlic Cloves
- 2 Tsp Salt

- Dash of Oregano

## Directions

1. Cut pork into large 2-inch cubes.
2. Place pork and all additional ingredients into the pot making sure to squeeze the orange to release some of the juice.
3. Add 1 cup of water or stock and stir ingredients around until salt is evenly distributed.
4. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover the pot.
5. Cover the pot and cook for 2-3 hours until tender, checking every 45 minutes to ensure it's cooking properly and nothing is burning.
