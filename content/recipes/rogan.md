# Rogan Josh

I used to work at an Indian resturant and Lamb Rogan Josh was my go-to meal after my shift. This recipe is adapted from a recipe I found online and uses beef as a substitute as lamb is harder to come by. While not as good as the resturant's, it is wonderfully spiced and full of savory flavor this is a go to recipe for the weekend.
