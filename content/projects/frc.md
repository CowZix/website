# First Robotics Challenge

I was on FIRST Robotics Challenge Team 619 Cavalier Robotics from 2017 to 2020 and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I learned so much about coding, 3D modeling, collaboration, and so much more during my time on the team. In 2019, our team was able win the Chesapeake district championship, earning the first 2 "Blue Banners" of the team's history as well as qualifying for the World Championship. Due to a scheduling conflict I was able to be a part of the drive team while at the World Championship, making it as the 4th seed in the Carson Division with a record of 8-4.

The following year, I was promoted to Programming Lead but unfortunately the year got cut short due to COVID just after our first competition.
