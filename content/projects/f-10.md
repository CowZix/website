# STS 4500 - F1/10 Autonomous Racing - Principles of Perception, Planning, and Control

## Overview

During the 2023 Fall Semester, I took [F1/10 Autonomous Racing - Principles of Perception, Planning, and Control](https://www.f1tenth.racing/). This turned out to be one of my favorite classes I've taken at UVA and I highly recommend it to anyone in the CS department. it was a lot of fun to iterate on the car algorithm to get the fastest times possible, and my group spent many hours fine tuning our algorithm late into the night.
